- Use more classes (eg glasses) and improve dir structure
- Consider training classes jointly (how to pick direction in this case? Check diff decoder github)
- Automate the step size (to reach prop 1 at the end), normalize the direction vector
- Check cartesian vs spherical
- Check the accuracy in data space
- Use FFHQ model
- Try to package
- Double check spherical coordinate converter

- Use whole dataset HPC or GD
- Train jointly
- Check normalization
